## 📝 Introduction
### 🚀 Motivation

Currently, we rely on ChatGPT for searching, but it presents several issues:

### ⚠️ Problems:
-  **Hallucination** – The model sometimes generates inaccurate or misleading information.
-  **Incomplete Results** – It does not retrieve all relevant matches.

### ✅ Solution:
#### This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** designed to handle large datasets, specifically for **legal text analysis and retrieval**. It leverages:
- **MongoDB** for document storage and retrieval.
- **OpenAI embeddings** for semantic search.
- **Annoy-based vector search** for efficient similarity-based matching.

### 🎯 Key Improvements:
-  **Reduced Hallucination** – By restricting searches to a **local domain**, we drastically lower the chances of misinformation.
-  **Higher Accuracy** – Utilizing the **latest OpenAI embedding model**, we aim to surpass existing solutions in precision and relevance.
-  **Optimized API Usage** – By caching and saving search queries and keep the embedding in the storage, we **reduce API costs** while maintaining efficient retrieval.
-  **Fast Search Engine** – By using the prebuild annoy index, we **reduce the time of search** .

## 📊 Features
### 🔹 Key Features
-  Scalable Large-Scale Data Processing – Designed for handling extensive datasets efficiently.
-  ChatGPT API with the Latest Embedding Model – Ensures high-accuracy text search and retrieval.
-  Optimized RAG Pipeline – Balances retrieval accuracy and generation quality for better responses.
- Local Vector Database Storage – Saves embeddings locally to minimize API calls, reducing cost and improving speed.
- Customizable & Extendable – Easily tweak settings, vector database configurations, and embeddings.

### 💡 How It Works
- Preprocess Large Datasets : Loads and processes structured or unstructured data.
- Generate & Store Embeddings : Uses ChatGPT embeddings and saves them locally for vector-based search.
- Efficient Retrieval & Augmentation : Quickly fetches relevant data using an optimized vector search engine.
- ChatGPT-Powered Responses : The system refines retrieved results and generates intelligent, context-aware responses.
- API Optimization : By caching embeddings and search results, the system reduces redundant API calls.

### 🔹 Data Processing & Storage
- Data Ingestion – Reads and loads structured/unstructured documents from a JSONL file into MongoDB.
-  Embedding Generation – Uses OpenAI's embedding API to convert text into high-dimensional vector representations for efficient search.

### 🔍 Intelligent Search & Retrieval
-  Vector Search – Employs Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors) for fast and scalable vector-based document retrieval.
-  Similarity Ranking – Uses cosine similarity to rank and filter the most relevant documents based on the user query.

### 🧠 AI-Powered Summarization
- Context-Aware Summarization – Extracts insights from the top 10 retrieved cases and summarizes results using ChatGPT.

### ⚙️ Modular Architecture 
- Data Ingestion: Reads documents and stores them in MongoDB.
- Embedding Generation: Uses OpenAI's embedding API to convert text into high-dimensional vectors.
- Search Emgine: Utilizes Annoy for efficient, approximate nearest neighbor searches.
- Similarity Ranking: Applies cosine similarity to filter and rank relevant documents.
- Summarization: Summarizes the top 10 retrieved cases using ChatGPT.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
### 1. 🖥️ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vector-rag-system.git
cd vector-rag-system
```
### 2. 📦 Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you do not have MongoDB:
🔗 [Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)
### 3. 🔧 Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root with the following content:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here # Get OpenAI'API 
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/   # Local

Summary (Similarity: 0.43):
This excerpt is from the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlines several fundamental rights and freedoms. It prohibits Congress from enacting legislation that establishes any religion or impedes the free practice of religion. Additionally, it safeguards freedoms related to speech, the press, peaceful assembly, and the right to petition the government to address grievances.

Top Insights:
1. **Religious Freedom**: The First Amendment ensures both the prevention of a government-mandated religion and the protection of individuals' rights to practice religion as they choose.
2. **Freedom of Speech and Press**: These freedoms are crucial for a democratic society, allowing individuals to express themselves and share information without undue government interference.
3. **Right to Assemble and Petition**: Citizens have the right to gather peacefully and to seek governmental changes, which supports public participation in democracy and accountability from elected officials.
